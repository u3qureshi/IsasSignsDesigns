Isa’s Signs & Designs — Project Status & Execution Plan
Version 2.0 (Living Document)
Last updated: 2026-02-21

Business
- Isa’s Signs & Designs (laser-cut + engraving; personal + business/events)

Primary goals
- Fast, clear storefront UX with premium feel
- Data-driven catalog so product updates do not require frontend code edits
- Simple solo-dev operations and maintainability
- Canada-first performance and dependable checkout

Tech stack (current)
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind
- Backend: Spring Boot (scaffolded)
- Database: Postgres (Docker Compose local)
- Payments: Stripe (planned)

================================================================================
1) Executive summary — where we are now
================================================================================

What is working now
- Frontend shell and branding are implemented.
- Header UX has been heavily refined and is responsive.
- Navigation now uses route-based links (no chevron dropdowns).
- Page skeletons were added for all current navigation destinations.
- Backend scaffold exists with Postgres schema + seed data + product read endpoints.
- Postgres container can be launched locally via Docker Compose.

What is not complete yet
- Frontend is still not wired to fetch products from backend.
- Backend runtime is blocked by Gradle wrapper/build config issues.
- Cart, checkout session creation, webhooks, and order lifecycle are not implemented.

Current project phase
- Transition phase from “UI-first” to “data-driven catalog integration.”

================================================================================
2) Frontend — completed so far
================================================================================

Core UI and routing delivered
- Header rework from static/complex menu to simpler route links.
- Removed all chevrons/dropdowns from top nav.
- Added React Router route skeletons for:
  - /
  - /best-sellers
  - /ramadan-decor
  - /wall-art
  - /home-decor
  - /kids
  - /business-events
  - /faq

Branding and assets
- Updated and integrated brand assets for:
  - Maple leaf icon
  - Handmade icon
- Set logo/icon text colors to match brown theme tokens.
- Made logo/title + decorative blocks clickable to homepage where intended.

Header behavior improvements implemented
- Promo strip with close action and “SHOP NOW” link.
- Sticky second row behavior preserved.
- Decorative left-side maple/handmade block shown only when not scrolled.
- Responsive tuning for search area + logo blocks.
- Converted several fixed dimensions to fluid clamp-based sizing.

Responsive refinement completed
- Search field in top row now shrinks dynamically rather than abrupt snapping.
- Search area tuned to avoid overlap with maple/handmade decorative block.
- Maple/handmade block made fluid and visible down to configured width threshold.
- Navigation typography/gaps moved toward fluid scaling.

Frontend quality status
- Frontend builds successfully in current state.
- UX tuning remains iterative, but base architecture is stable enough for data integration.

================================================================================
3) Backend — completed so far
================================================================================

Data layer and local DB setup
- Docker Compose added for local Postgres.
- Database init script creates products schema and seeds sample rows.
- Seed rows include representative categories used by storefront sections.

API scaffold completed
- Spring Boot project scaffold added with:
  - application entrypoint
  - JPA entity for Product
  - repository with category + slug lookups
  - controller endpoints for product list/detail
- Endpoints implemented:
  - GET /api/products
  - GET /api/products?category=<category>
  - GET /api/products/{slug}

Backend status caveats
- Backend compile/run not yet finalized due to Gradle wrapper/build setup mismatch.
- Some hardening is still pending:
  - DTO response layer
  - proper 404 handling
  - input validation
  - CORS config
  - migration tooling

================================================================================
4) Current blockers and risks
================================================================================

Primary blockers
- Gradle wrapper missing (./gradlew unavailable).
- build.gradle compatibility issue surfaced during wrapper generation.

Secondary cleanup required
- Docker Compose version field warning (non-blocking but noisy).
- Build/Gradle cache artifacts should be cleaned from git tracking in follow-up.

Product/data design decisions pending
- Whether to keep images as JSON text for MVP or normalize into product_images table now.
- Whether “Best Sellers” should be computed/tag-based vs static category.

================================================================================
5) Current information architecture (live in UI)
================================================================================

Current menu categories/routes
- Best Sellers
- Ramadan Decor
- Wall Art
- Home Decor
- Kids
- Business/Events
- FAQ

Note
- FAQ is content-oriented, not product-category-oriented, and should remain a content route.

================================================================================
6) Next implementation plan (recommended sequence)
================================================================================

Phase A — Stabilize backend runtime (immediate)
1. Fix build.gradle and generate Gradle wrapper.
2. Start backend locally and verify API returns seeded products.
3. Add basic CORS for local frontend origin.

Definition of done for Phase A
- Backend runs locally on configured port.
- /api/products and /api/products/{slug} respond successfully.

Phase B — Connect frontend to live product data
1. Add API client layer in frontend.
2. Replace page skeleton placeholders with product-grid rendering by category.
3. Add loading/error/empty UI states.

Definition of done for Phase B
- Product cards render from DB-backed API responses.
- Add/remove products in DB reflected in UI without code changes.

Phase C — Product detail + cart foundation
1. Add product detail route integration from slug.
2. Introduce cart state and add-to-cart actions.
3. Ensure pricing is sourced from backend, not hardcoded.

Phase D — Checkout and order reliability
1. Implement POST /checkout/session in backend.
2. Integrate Stripe hosted checkout redirect.
3. Add webhook endpoint to mark orders PAID.
4. Persist orders + order_items.

================================================================================
7) Future goals (post-MVP)
================================================================================

Product management
- Internal admin view for add/edit/deactivate products.
- Inventory and fulfillment status updates.

Storefront enhancements
- Better filtering, sorting, search relevance.
- Collections and merchandising (best sellers, seasonal).
- Improved media handling (multiple images/video).

Reliability and operations
- Flyway/Liquibase migrations.
- Structured logging + error monitoring.
- Staging environment and release checklist.

Performance and SEO
- Image optimization pipeline (WebP/AVIF).
- Route-level code splitting and caching strategy.
- Metadata and structured data for product pages.

================================================================================
8) MVP definition of done (updated)
================================================================================

A customer can:
- Browse category pages powered by backend products
- Open a product detail page
- Add products to cart
- Complete Stripe checkout

The system can:
- Persist orders in Postgres
- Confirm payment via webhook and update order status
- Serve a fast, mobile-friendly experience

================================================================================
9) Practical operating model for product updates
================================================================================

Target workflow
- Add product: insert new DB row
- Remove product: set is_active=false
- Update details/pricing/images: update DB row(s)

Outcome
- Product operations happen in data/admin tools, not frontend code edits.

================================================================================
10) Short-term action checklist (owner-ready)
================================================================================

Immediate (today/next session)
- Fix Gradle wrapper/build configuration
- Boot backend and verify API with curl
- Wire one route (e.g., Home Decor) to live API

This week
- Wire remaining category routes
- Build product card + product detail from API
- Start cart state and checkout session endpoint

After that
- Stripe webhook + order persistence
- Staging deploy + production hardening
