1. What we have completed so far
We intentionally completed brand assets and UX decisions first to unblock development. The focus is speed, clarity, and a premium-but-simple storefront experience.
Completed assets
Asset	Output	Notes
Logo mark	user_logo.png	Palm/tree + pen nib mark (modern, natural, crafted)
Title lockup	IsaSignsAndDesignsTITLELOGO (SVG + PNG)	SVG: editable AOKI text + embedded fallback
Typography	AOKI	AOKI for brand consistency (with system-ui fallback for performance where needed)
Header UX (desktop)	mockup_desktop_before_after.png	Double stacked header that collapses into sticky nav
Header UX (mobile)	mockup_mobile_before_after.png	Sticky nav with hamburger + cart
Shop UX	mockup_collection_filters.png	Sticky nav + filter sidebar for fast browsing

Reference mockups (alignment)


2. Website goals and UX decisions
Top priorities
Speed over aesthetics: fast initial load, fast navigation, fast checkout.
Clarity: customers immediately understand what you offer (Personal + Business/Events).
Premium feel without complexity: whitespace, strong typography, simple components.
Solo-dev maintainability: minimal dependencies, predictable structure, simple deployment.
Sticky header behavior
Double stacked header:- Header Row 1 (top): logo mark + company name- Header Row 2 (nav): menu, search, cartOn scroll, Row 2 becomes sticky and Row 1 collapses; the logo + name animate into the left side of the sticky nav.
What this achieves
Navigation, search, and cart are always accessible.
Brand presence at the top without stealing space while browsing.
Matches premium reference patterns (Apple/Brooklinen-style clarity).
3. Information architecture (pages and navigation)
Primary routes:
Route	Purpose
/	Home (hero + featured + collections + trust)
/shop/personal	Personal storefront (grid + filters)
/shop/business-events	Business/Events (packages + gallery + inquiry; optional products)
/product/:slug	Product details
/cart	Cart (or cart drawer)
/checkout	Redirect to Stripe Checkout (hosted)
/order/success	Order confirmation
/faq	FAQ (shipping, processing time, materials)
/about	About + story + craftsmanship
/contact	Contact / custom request

Sticky navigation menu items
Shop • Wall Art • Kids • Nikkah / Events • Business Signs • About • FAQ • Search • Cart
4. Frontend plan (React + shadcn/ui)
Why shadcn/ui
shadcn/ui is a set of components copied into your project, which helps keep the shipped UI lightweight because you only include what you use. It’s a strong fit for a modern, fast storefront.
Core frontend libraries
Tool	Why
React + Vite	Fast development and builds
Tailwind CSS	Consistent layout + typography, easy to maintain
shadcn/ui (Radix)	Accessible UI primitives (NavigationMenu, Sheet, Dialog, etc.)
React Router	Simple routing (or Next.js later if needed)

Frontend MVP deliverables
Header: double-stack -> sticky transform; responsive mobile nav drawer
Home: hero, featured products, collections, trust section, footer
Shop: grid, filter sidebar (desktop), filter drawer (mobile)
Product: gallery, variations (size/material), add-to-cart
Cart + checkout button
5. Backend plan (Spring Boot + Postgres)
Responsibilities
Serve product catalog and pricing (public).
Create Stripe Checkout sessions (server-side).
Receive Stripe webhooks and mark orders as PAID.
Admin endpoints later: add/edit products, manage inventory, fulfillment status.
Minimal data model
Table	Fields (summary)
products	id, slug, name, description, price_cents, collection, material, active
product_images	id, product_id, url, sort_order
orders	id, email, total_cents, status, stripe_session_id, created_at
order_items	id, order_id, product_id, qty, unit_price_cents

6. Checkout and order flow (Stripe)
MVP checkout will use Stripe-hosted Checkout for speed and reliability. Frontend requests a Checkout Session from the backend and redirects the user to Stripe. A Stripe webhook confirms payment and updates the Order record.
Flow
User adds items to cart (frontend).
Frontend calls POST /checkout/session with cart items.
Backend validates prices and creates Stripe Checkout Session.
Frontend redirects to Stripe-hosted checkout URL.
Stripe sends webhook event to backend.
Backend marks order PAID and triggers fulfillment workflow.
7. Performance plan (Canada-first speed)
Primary levers
CDN in front of static assets (images, JS, CSS).
Next-gen images (WebP/AVIF) + compression.
Avoid heavy fonts: if using AOKI, load only the weights you need.
Lazy-load below-the-fold images and prefetch key routes.
Cache product API responses (ETag/short TTL).
CDN options
CDN	Notes
Cloudflare	Great default; easy setup and strong performance.
AWS CloudFront	Excellent if using AWS (S3/RDS/App Runner).
Vercel CDN	Excellent DX if hosting frontend on Vercel.

8. Deployment plan (dev/staging/prod)
Recommended simple setup
Frontend: static hosting with CDN (Vercel or AWS Amplify). Backend: container deployment (AWS App Runner/ECS) or EC2 + Docker if necessary. Database: managed Postgres when possible.
Environments
Environment	Purpose
Local	Docker Compose for Postgres; run frontend/backend locally.
Staging	Test Stripe in test mode; verify webhooks; content review.
Production	CDN enabled; monitoring; backups; rate limiting.

9. Roadmap and milestones
MVP roadmap for a solo developer:
Milestone	Deliverable	Target
Milestone 1	Repo setup + styling system + header animation + routing	1-2 days
Milestone 2	Home + Shop + Product pages with mock data	2-3 days
Milestone 3	Backend /products API + Postgres schema + seed data	2-3 days
Milestone 4	Cart + Stripe Checkout + webhook + order confirmation	2-3 days
Milestone 5	Deployment (staging -> prod) + CDN + monitoring	1-2 days

10. Next steps to start development
Start here (Day 1)
Create a Git repo (monorepo recommended: /frontend and /backend).
Initialize frontend: Vite + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
Build the header + sticky transform first (core UX).
Create routes: /, /shop/personal, /shop/business-events, /product/:slug.
Stub product data (JSON) and build UI flows end-to-end.
Then start backend with Spring Boot + Postgres + GET /products.

Definition of done for MVP
Customer can browse products, view a product, add to cart, and pay via Stripe Checkout.
Order is recorded in Postgres and marked PAID via webhook.
Site is deployed behind a CDN and loads quickly on mobile.
FAQ/Shipping/Processing pages are present and clear.
